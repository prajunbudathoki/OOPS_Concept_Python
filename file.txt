1. class and object (example)
2. class has data/attribute and functions/methods
    --> code walkthrough
    --> attributes get called itself where methods need to be called manually
3. why python is called OOP? (everything in python is an object (data types,etc.))
4. Advantages of OOP:
    -> we can create our data types
    -> Easy to debug
    -> code reusability
    -> easy to colab
